**Abstract:** An automotive compatible integrated sensory system is designed to identify the physical discomfort of the passenger traveling in the public transportation system. The integrated system involves an array of pressure sensitive conductive (PSC) sensors designed on the seat and on the backrest to enable physically harassed state identification. The emergency vigilance system designed for modern public passenger vehicles such as local cabs and bus communicates to a response team under emergency. The designed array of PSC sensors presents real-time signals leading to the classification of steady state and physical discomfort state of the passenger. A prototype of emergency vigilance system including evidence capture using night vision camera, audio recording by microphone, GPS based location sharing, and communication of IP message to emergency response team is developed to realize the working of the overall system. The night vision camera has the facility to record short duration videos and upload to a secured content delivery network (CDN) channel. The developed autonomous passenger state identification is scalable to other modes of transportation systems, including railway coaches, and air flights.
