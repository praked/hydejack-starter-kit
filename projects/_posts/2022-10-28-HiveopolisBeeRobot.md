I was involved in the design and development of a Robot bee platform for mimicking bee wangle dance in a real beehive as a part of
the EU H2020 funded project ’Hiveopolis’. In theory, such a robot could guide honeybees to a safe foraging site if humans determined that another site was contaminated with pesticides and was affecting the hive’s health. Also humans could direct honeybees away from a site that was being reserved for wild bees.
