I am working on a swarm of autonomous sailboats optimized for long-duration endurance. This has been a combination of learning about sailing and applying my skills and knowledge in Embedded systems and Robotics.

The project is in its nascent stages, so here are some cooling-looking robotic sailboats to amuse you. credits: SailDrone

But I guess our boat is going to look probably more like this and about 1.2m or so long.
